# Clean Code Guidelines

## Constants Over Magic Numbers
- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file

## Meaningful Names
- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood

## Smart Comments
- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects

## Single Responsibility
- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth

## Clean Structure
- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

## Encapsulation
- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions

## Code Quality Maintenance
- Refactor continuously
- Fix technical debt early
- Leave code cleaner than you found it

## Testing
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Keep tests readable and maintainable
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Version Control
- Write clear commit messages
- Make small, focused commits
- Use meaningful branch names

# Code Quality Guidelines

## Verify Information
Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.

## File-by-File Changes
Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.

## No Apologies
Never use apologies.

## No Understanding Feedback
Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.

## No Whitespace Suggestions
Don't suggest whitespace changes.

## No Summaries
Don't summarize changes made.

## No Inventions
Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.

## No Unnecessary Confirmations
Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.

## Preserve Existing Code
Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

## Single Chunk Edits
Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.

## No Implementation Checks
Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.

## No Unnecessary Updates
Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.

## Provide Real File Links
Always provide links to the real files, not x.md.

## No Current Implementation
Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.

# Next.js Best Practices

## Project Structure
- Use the App Router directory structure
- Place components in `app` directory for route-specific components
- Place shared components in `components` directory
- Place utilities and helpers in `lib` directory
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`)

## Components
- Use Server Components by default
- Mark client components explicitly with 'use client'
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Place static content and interfaces at file end

## Performance
- Optimize images: Use WebP format, size data, lazy loading
- Minimize use of 'useEffect' and 'setState'
- Favor Server Components (RSC) where possible
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Data Fetching
- Use Server Components for data fetching when possible
- Implement proper error handling for data fetching
- Use appropriate caching strategies
- Handle loading and error states appropriately

## Routing
- Use the App Router conventions
- Implement proper loading and error states for routes
- Use dynamic routes appropriately
- Handle parallel routes when needed

## Forms and Validation
- Use Zod for form validation
- Implement proper server-side validation
- Handle form errors appropriately
- Show loading states during form submission

## State Management
- Minimize client-side state
- Use React Context sparingly
- Prefer server state when possible
- Implement proper loading states

# TypeScript Best Practices

## Type System
- Prefer interfaces over types for object definitions
- Use type for unions, intersections, and mapped types
- Avoid using `any`, prefer `unknown` for unknown types
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Leverage TypeScript's built-in utility types
- Use generics for reusable type patterns

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for type names and interfaces
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Prefix interfaces for React props with 'Props' (e.g., ButtonProps)

## Code Organization
- Keep type definitions close to where they're used
- Export types and interfaces from dedicated type files when shared
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for organizing exports
- Place shared types in a `types` directory
- Co-locate component props with their components

## Functions
- Use explicit return types for public functions
- Use arrow functions for callbacks and methods
- Implement proper error handling with custom error types
- Use function overloads for complex type scenarios
- Prefer async/await over Promises

## Best Practices
- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Use readonly for immutable properties
- Leverage discriminated unions for type safety
- Use type guards for runtime type checking
- Implement proper null checking
- Avoid type assertions unless necessary

## Error Handling
- Create custom error types for domain-specific errors
- Use Result types for operations that can fail
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use try-catch blocks with typed catch clauses
- Handle Promise rejections properly

## Patterns
- Use the Builder pattern for complex object creation
- Implement the Repository pattern for data access
- Use the Factory pattern for object creation
- Leverage dependency injection
- Use the Module pattern for encapsulation
